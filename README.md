# Java Collections Practice

Hands-on practice of the **Java Collections Framework** with a focus on
**core fundamentals, data-structure intuition, and interview readiness**.

This repository contains small, self-contained Java programs.
Each class demonstrates **how and when a specific collection is used**.

## What’s covered so far

### List

#### ArrayList
- Creation and initialization
- CRUD operations
- Different iteration techniques
- Removing duplicates without extra collections
- Understanding index vs value-based operations

#### LinkedList
- Node-based structure (conceptual understanding)
- Insertion and removal at ends
- Traversal behavior
- Comparison with ArrayList (use-case driven)

#### Vector (awareness)
- Legacy synchronized list
- Why it exists and why it’s avoided today

## Structure
- One concept or problem per class
- Each class has its own `main` method
- Minimal abstractions
- Code-first learning approach
- Internal workings of Collections
