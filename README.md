# Java Collections Practice

Hands-on practice of the **Java Collections Framework** with a focus on
**problem solving and interview readiness**.

This repository contains small, self-contained Java programs.
Each class solves **one specific problem** using a collection.

---

## What’s covered so far

### ArrayList
- Basic CRUD operations
- Different iteration techniques
- Removing duplicates without using extra collections
- Understanding index vs value-based operations

---

## Structure
- One problem per class
- Each class has its own `main` method
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Focus on clarity and correctness

---

## Goal
To build strong fundamentals in Java Collections
and be able to confidently explain **when and why** a collection is used.
